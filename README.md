# Random Scenario

one of my first projects I attempted in my growth with Python was using random functions.
This code is kinda simple, just might look intimidating.
The code could be even more simpified but this was just for experiment and self learning.

I would like to convert the code so it asks the user which topic it would like to select.

which scenario would you like to run?

1.crime
2.war
3.politics.
4.weather

#user enters '2"

#prints (war) scenarios.

hope this program can help beginners like myself. 
This was the first program that I fully made from scratch on a blank screen. Trying to use what Ive learned and putting that knowledge to the test.
